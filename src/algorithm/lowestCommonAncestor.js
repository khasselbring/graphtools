 * Find the lowest common ancestors (LCAs) of a set of locations.

 * The locations can be ports or nodes or a mix of ports and nodes. If the location is a node it
 * can be part of the LCAs. If the location identifies a port the corresponding node will not be
 * part of the result. The locations must all have the exact same parent.
 * @param {Portgraph} graph The graph
 * @returns {Array<Node>} An array of nodes that represent the LCAs.
 * @throws {Error} An error is thrown if it is not possible to calculate the LCAs. This might be because:
 *  - the locations array is no array or does not have at least 2 nodes.
 *  - the corresponding nodes to the locations do not all have the same parent.
